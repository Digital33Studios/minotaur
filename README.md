# Minotaur: The Labyrinth of Crete

<p align="center"><img src="./Screenshots/Screen_0.png"></p>

Enter the labyrinth and test your courage and wit. Will you survive to the exit, or will you perish at the mighty axe of the MINOTAUR?

The initial maze size and Minotaur speed is determined by the Difficulty Level you select. Each time you successfully exit the maze the Difficulty multiplier increases by .1 as does the map size.
For Example if you choose Minotaur Difficulty which is Level 5 the maze will be 5times as large, and well as increase the Minotaur's Speed. 
Starting at the highest difficulty may cause some heavier load times, but trust me it will load. There is an encrypted-load/save system for Top-5 highscores as well as an initial entry system to keep track of who is the best!
